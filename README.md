# Pynac
This is a Python wrapper around the Dynac particle tracking code that allows it to be used from a Jupyter notebook environment.

Dynac is freeware software for simulating the behaviour of charged particle beams in particle accelerators.  Further information may be found here ---> https://dynac.web.cern.ch/dynac/dynac.html

It is important to note that the authors of the code found in this repository have no official link with the Dynac team.  The code found here is merely a wrapper around the Dynac executable.
