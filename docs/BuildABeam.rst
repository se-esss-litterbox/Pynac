Playing with input beam parameters
==================================

.. _a mock-up: _static/BuildABeam.html

Using Pynac, I was able to build a function, ``build_a_beam()`` that shows the beam
phase space for various values of the Twiss parameters.  This is done interactively
using iPython widgets.

Here is `a mock-up`_ of this to give an idea of how it should work.  Executing the same
code in your own Jupyter notebook will give you the desired functionality.
