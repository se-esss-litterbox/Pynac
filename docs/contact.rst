.. _please contact Stephen Molloy: sdmolloy@gmail.com
.. _please contact the Dynac authors: dynac.support@cern.ch

In case of issues with Pynac itself (as opposed to the Dynac, Fortran-based, executable),
or with any of the other details of the Python wrapper, `please contact Stephen Molloy`_.

Otherwise, `please contact the Dynac authors`_.

.. warning:: Pynac requires at least v17 of Dynac.  This is yet to be released,
             and so Pynac users will have to make do with the unofficial version
             of Dynac included with Pynac.

             **The Dynac authors are very unlikely to be willing to offer help
             to people using this unofficial version and so you may need to be
             patient enough to wait for the official release of Dynac v17.**
