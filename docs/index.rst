Pynac is a Python wrapper around Dynac, which is an executable used for simulating
the motion of charged particles through accelerator beamlines.  More details can
be found on the Dynac homepage.

Pynac allows for a very interactive style of use, while also allowing large-scale
simulations to be performed on multi-core, multi-CPU, machines without supervision.
We believe this flexibility is of huge benefit to those designing and modelling
charged-particle beamlines.
