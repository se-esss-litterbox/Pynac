Installation
============

Proper installation instructions will come soon, but for the moment it follows
the standard Python style.  If you don't understand the following, you're probably
not a Python dev., and so should wait for the proper instructions to be written
(super soon -- I promise).

#. Grab the code from Github.
#. Start a Python3 virtual environment.
#. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
#. Download the Dynac source file (Fortran).
#. Compile with ``gfortran`` and make sure the executable is in your path.
